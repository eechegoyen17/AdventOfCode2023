# Advent of Code 2023
## Introduction
Advent of Code is a yearly event made by the Zero to Mastery Community, it involves a series of puzzles that you need to resolve each day through December 1st to December 25th.

Each day there'll be 1 puzzle with 2 parts, each part will grant 1 star for a total of 50 stars.

## Methodology
Each day will have it's own folder where the solution for each puzzle will be stored.

Each day puzzle has a main program with the solution of each part of the day, an input text and a readme file with the premise of each puzzle.

I'll be doing each day in Python first, but I'll try to solve each day in Java and C# if I get the time to do so, just to practice each sintax.
